# AE 544 Analytical Dynamics Programming Project 01
## By: Jasmine Nakladov

This project asks to write three (3) numerical programs to simulate three scnerios, all of which will include the approach or hit of a singularity or ambiguity. The scenarios are as follows:

1. Singularity for Asymmetric Euler Angle Sets
2. Ambiguity of Euler Parameters / Quaternions
3. Classical Rodriques Parameters

This will be accomplished by integrating an attitude or dynamics equation with initial conditions. The angular velocity vecotr initial condition will be manipulated to ensure the singularity/ambiguity is approached. An additional goal of this project is to investigate whether different numerical integrators affect the singularity problem in different ways. The investiaget integrators will be as follows: *ode45*, *ode4*, and *ode15s*. 

Finally, a 3D animation will be included to aid in analyzing each simulation.
